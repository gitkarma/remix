It provides a convenient method to do interactive embedded development in PicoC, a light weight C language interpreter. PicoC offers a rich subset of regular ANSI C language functions. Remix is available under the MIT free software license.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Full control of the platform: There is no requisite for an Operating System between your programs and the microcontroller\r\n- Source code portability: Any program being interpretted can also be easily compiled\r\n- Shell environment for user interaction \r\n- Optimized for memory consumption (look into tiny RAM patch)\r\n- FAT file system (e.g. for the SD/MMC card interface)\r\n- XMODEM protocol for convenient sharing of files with PC \r\n\r\n"}
